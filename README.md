Overview 
The challenge focuses on predicting self-driving vehicle trajectories using various input data sources.

Input Data
Vehicle Metadata
Vehicle ID
Model specifications
Tire type and conditions
Localization Data
Real-time coordinates
Vehicle orientation
Control Commands
Acceleration inputs
Steering parameters
Task Description
Given: First 5 seconds of trajectory + 20 seconds of control commands
Goal: Predict vehicle positions at specific timestamps (5-20 seconds)
Evaluation: Accuracy of predicted positions vs. actual trajectories
